# React Component Architecture: Patterns for Reusable Code

**Are your components becoming difficult to reuse and maintain, causing inconsistency in the UI?**

As a front-end developer myself, building user interfaces, I've found that one thing that always creates a mess is when a simple component turns out to be the most complex and causes inconsistency across the application. That's when I realized that I need a better strategy — not just for how components are written, but for _architecting_ them such that they can scale.

In this article, I’ll outline how I structure React component architecture patterns to help me write clean, reusable, and maintainable code.

## Why Component Architecture Matters in React

Whenever I start building complex UI, my components quickly become bloated and hard to reuse. Then I started reading about component architecture, and it turned out to be more than just folder structure — it’s about how you **design**, **compose**, and **reuse** components effectively.

That's why having the right component architecture provides:

- **Maintainability**: Changes made in one place show everywhere.
- **Consistency**: Makes UI look uniform across the application.
- **Scalability**: Clean architecture helps new developers onboard faster.
- **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to test.

## Atomic Design: My Go-To Method for Organizing Components

The first concept I came across was **Atomic Design** by Brad Frost while learning about design systems. Atomic Design breaks your UI into 5 levels: **atoms**, **molecules**, **organisms**, **templates**, and **pages**.

### How I used this concept:

#### Atoms

These are the smallest components — inputs, buttons, text labels, icons.

```tsx
// components/atoms/Button.tsx
const Button = ({ children, ...props }) => (
  <button className="rounded px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white" {...props}>
    {children}
  </button>
);
```

#### Molecules

Combination of two or more atoms — a label + input field, or icon + text.

```tsx
// components/molecules/InputField.tsx
const InputField = ({ label, ...props }) => (
  <div>
    <label>{label}</label>
    <input {...props} />
  </div>
);
```

#### Organisms

More complex or consist of two or more atoms/molecules — think forms, navbars, cards, etc.

```tsx
// components/organisms/LoginForm.tsx
const LoginForm = () => (
  <form>
    <InputField label="Email" type="email" />
    <InputField label="Password" type="password" />
    <Button>Login</Button>
  </form>
);
```

#### Templates and Pages

Consist of multiple organisms or layout structures.

## Prop Drilling vs Composition: Smarter Component Reuse

The most common issue I faced while making reusable components is **prop drilling** — passing data through multiple layers of React components.

### To avoid this:

#### ✅ Use Composition

Instead of passing children via props, I just let consumers control what gets rendered.

```tsx
const Card = ({ children }) => (
  <div className="border rounded p-4 shadow">{children}</div>
);

// Usage
<Card>
  <h2>Hello</h2>
  <p>This is a reusable card layout</p>
</Card>;
```

#### ✅ Use Context for Shared State

For deeply nested components (like a theme switcher or auth context), I use Context to avoid prop drilling altogether.

```tsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};

const ThemeSwitcher = () => {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button onClick={() => setTheme("dark")}>Switch to Dark</button>;
};
```

## Custom Hooks: The Backbone of Logic Reuse

While building a complex UI that consists of multiple components requiring the same logic at multiple places, copying and pasting the same logic across components becomes a nightmare. That's when I understood the importance of **using custom hooks**.

### How I Use Custom Hooks

Let’s say multiple components need to fetch and cache user data.

#### Instead of repeating this:

```tsx
const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  fetch("/api/user")
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then(setUser);
}, []);
```

#### I create a custom hook:

```tsx
// hooks/useUser.ts
const useUser = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/user")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return user;
};
```

#### Then in any component:

```tsx
const Profile = () => {
  const user = useUser();
  return <div>Hello, {user?.name}</div>;
};
```

## Guidelines for Writing Good Hooks

- Use `use` prefix (`useAuth`, `useCart`, `useDebounce`)
- Keep them **pure** — only handle side effects or logic, no UI rendering
- Split complex hooks into smaller ones when needed

## How I Structure Folders and Files in Large React Projects

After working on multiple projects, including those with 100+ components, what works best for me is a combination of **feature-based structure** mixed with **atomic principles**.

### My Typical Folder Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── atoms/
│   ├── molecules/
│   ├── organisms/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── LoginForm.tsx
│   │   ├── hooks/useLogin.ts
│   │   └── services/authApi.ts
│   └── dashboard/
│       ├── DashboardPage.tsx
│       ├── components/
│       └── hooks/
├── hooks/
├── pages/
├── utils/
├── styles/
└── types/
```

### Why I Like This Setup

- **Easy to locate**: All login-related code lives in `features/auth`
- **Separation of concerns**: UI in components, logic in hooks, API in services
- **Atomic design** inside `components` makes shared UI reusable

## Patterns I Avoid (And Why)

There are certain patterns I always avoid to make code more readable, reusable, and easy to understand:

- ❌ **Single Monolithic Components**  
  Components with more than 100–150 lines of code usually need refactoring.

- ❌ **Prop Explosion**  
  Passing 10+ props into a component usually signals a need for grouping via a config object or context.

- ❌ **Over-Abstraction Too Early**  
  Not everything needs abstraction. Many components I prematurely abstracted were never reused.

---

## Conclusion

Good architecture isn't about complexity — it's about building things so they’re **easy to change**.  
So now, before building a component I always ask these questions:

- Can this be used anywhere else?
- Is the logic tightly coupled with the UI?
- Can I isolate the data fetching or state into a hook?
- Is this component readable and understandable in 30 seconds?

By adapting patterns like **Atomic Design**, using **custom hooks**, and organizing code by **feature**, my React projects have become much more maintainable — even as they scale.
