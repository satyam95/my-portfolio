# React Component Architecture: Patterns for Reusable Code

Building a scalable React application often comes down to the attention paid to component architecture and design patterns. When components are designed thoughtfully, they can be reused across a project, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability. In this article, we will explore several established patterns for creating reusable React components, including Presentational vs Container components, Higher-Order Components (HOCs), Render Props, Compound Components, Custom Hooks, and the Atomic Design methodology. Along the way, we'll include code snippets and folder-structure recommendations to illustrate best practices.

## 1. Presentational vs Container Components

A long-standing pattern in React is the separation of **Presentational** (or “Dumb”) components from **Container** (or “Smart”) components. This approach enforces a clear delineation of responsibilities:

- **Presentational Components**

  - Concerned solely with how things look.
  - Receive data and callbacks via props.
  - Rarely have their own state (except for UI-specific state, such as a dropdown’s open/closed status).
  - Often written as functional components.

- **Container Components**
  - Handle data fetching, state management, and business logic.
  - Pass data down to Presentational components as props.
  - Connect to Redux, Context, GraphQL queries, or other data sources.

### Example

```jsx
// components/Button.tsx (Presentational)
import React from "react";

interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  label,
  onClick,
  disabled = false,
}) => (
  <button
    onClick={onClick}
    disabled={disabled}
    className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
  >
    {label}
  </button>
);
```

```jsx
// containers/SubmitButtonContainer.tsx (Container)
import React from "react";
import { useSubmitFormMutation } from "../hooks/useSubmitFormMutation";
import { Button } from "../components/Button";

export const SubmitButtonContainer: React.FC = () => {
  const { submitForm, isLoading } = useSubmitFormMutation();

  const handleClick = () => {
    submitForm();
  };

  return (
    <Button
      label={isLoading ? "Submitting..." : "Submit"}
      onClick={handleClick}
      disabled={isLoading}
    />
  );
};
```

By splitting UI and logic, each component remains focused and reusable. You can swap out the Button in other contexts, and the container can be modified to handle different forms without touching the UI.
