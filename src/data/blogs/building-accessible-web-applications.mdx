# Building Accessible Web Applications with React and Next.js

Accessibility (often abbreviated as **a11y**) is essential to ensuring that web applications can be used by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int), over 1 billion people worldwide experience some form of disability. As developers, it’s our responsibility to implement strategies that make applications perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users. In this article, we’ll cover accessibility principles and demonstrate how to apply them in React and Next.js projects.

## 1. Understanding Accessibility Principles (POUR)

The **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** outline four core principles, often remembered by the acronym **POUR**:

1. **Perceivable**

   - Information and UI must be presented so users can perceive it (vision, hearing, etc.).
   - Use semantic HTML, alt text for images, captions for video/audio.

2. **Operable**

   - UI controls must be operable via keyboard, screen readers, or other assistive technologies.
   - Ensure focus indicators, keyboard navigation (e.g., `tabindex`), and avoid time-sensitive interactions without alternatives.

3. **Understandable**

   - Information and operation must be understandable—clear language, consistent UI, and error messages.
   - Use ARIA attributes judiciously to clarify component behavior.

4. **Robust**
   - Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by various user agents, including assistive technologies.
   - Adhere to valid, semantic HTML and keep dependencies updated.

## 2. Semantic HTML and ARIA Roles in React

Even though React abstracts away direct DOM manipulation, you still need to use semantic HTML elements whenever possible. For instance:

```jsx
// components/AccessibleButton.tsx
import React from "react";

interface AccessibleButtonProps {
  onClick: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export const AccessibleButton: React.FC<AccessibleButtonProps> = ({
  onClick,
  disabled = false,
  children,
}) => (
  <button onClick={onClick} disabled={disabled} aria-disabled={disabled}>
    {children}
  </button>
);
```
